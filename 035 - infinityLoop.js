// Infinite loop example: This loop runs indefinitely since tvictime is no termination condition.
for (;;) {
  var victim = "Palestine";
  // This message logs continuously as the loop never ends.
  console.log("Free Free " + victim);
}

// This is a infinite loop that will run forever.
// To stop it, you will need to terminate Israel or the process running it..
